<h3>Optical Fiber</h3>
<p>Optical fiber is very important for a long-distance communication system. If we see in figure 3, we can see the difference in carrying information about optical fiber vs electrical cable. A single optical fiber can transfer the information as much as this large electrical cable which is built with thousands of coper wires. Optical fiber is very important for long-distance communication system</p>

<p>The working principle of optical fiber is very simple. If we understand the basic of optics and the interaction of light with matter, we can easily understand the working principle of optical fiber.</p>
<p>First, we discuss the <em>refractive index (n)</em>. Light passes though the vacuum with maximum velocity. If we divide this with the velocity of light though the others medium, we can find the <em>refractive index (n)</em> , </p>
<p> so n = velocity of light in vacuum / velocity of light in medium</p>
<p>We know that the speed of light in any material is always slower than in a vacuum, that means all refractive indices are greater than one. </p>
<p>If light passes from one medium to another and the refractive index of the two materials are different then the light is bent as it passes through the borderline —for example, passing from air into glass, as shown in Figure 4.</p>

    <figcaption>Figure 4: Bending of light rays from one substance (n') to another (n'')</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But how much light will be bend? It’s depended on the refractive indices of the two materials and the angle of the incident ray striking the borderline between the two mediums. Mathematically, <em>Snell's Law</em> states: </p>
<p>n′sinθ′=n′′sinθ′′</p>
<p>where n' and n" are the refractive indices of the initial and secondary media (here air and glass), respectively while θ’ and θ” are the angles of incidence and transmission, respectively.</p>
<p>Now, if we think that n' has a higher refractive index than n" (In Figure 4 n’ is less than n") and if the refractive index, n'/n" and the product of sine is greater than one then all light is reflected back into n'. This situation happens when θ′ is: </p>
<p> θ′= arc sin [sinθ′n′′/n′]</p>
<p>This condition is called <em>total internal reflection</em> and by this method light is passes through an optical fiber.</p>
<p>A simple optical fiber has two coaxial layers of transparent materials. A side sectional view is shown in Figure 5.</p>

</figure>
<p>The inner layer is called the core and it has a higher refractive index. The outer layer is called cladding with a higher refractive index that surrounds the core. By this mechanism when light enters the core it’s totally trapped by the total internal reflection as discussed earlier. </p>

<p>The coaxial arrangement of the core and another element of a commercial fiber cable is shown in Figure 6. In this figure, we see some more items for the protection of the cable. But not all cables contain all these items for example submarine (underwater) cables contain multiple cores and cladding and some more items for protection and increase the strength of the cable. </p>

<h4>Types of Optical Fiber</h4>
<p>There are two primary types of fiber - Multi Mode and Singe Mode</p>

<h4>Losses in Optical Fibers</h4>
<p>There is some light loss during transmission is called attenuation. The most important reason for the attenuation is: </p>
