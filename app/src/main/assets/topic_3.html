<h3>Fiber optic Transmitter </h3>
<p>The fiber optic transmitter is very important part of optical fiber. It’s called the heart of any optical fiber.</p>
<p>We use a wavelength between 800 – 900 nanometers (nm) to transmit light into optical fiber, because this is the wavelength of LED (Light Emitting Diode) technology. This technology is available at this time, maybe in future we will use different technology. </p>
<p>The two most popular light sources used in fiber optic transmitters are light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and laser diodes. They contribute more than 99 percent of communication applications.</p>
<br>
<h4>Sources of Light</h4>
<p>In short-to-medium distances communication LEDs are used as light sources, this devise is also used for short-to-medium frequency applications.</p>
<p>In medium-to-long distances communication laser diodes are used as light sources (like submarine cable under see) and also for medium-to-high frequency applications.</p>
<h5>LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes)</h5>
<p>There are some advantages of LED because it is  </p>
<ul>
    <li>Durable</li>
    <li>Cheap</li>
    <li>Easy to compel any electronic circuits</li>
    <li>Engery-efficient</li>
    <li>Tenacious</li>
</ul>
<p>LED emits light randomly in all directions. This behavior is very useful for an optical fiber. The light from a particular surface in LED as shown in Figure 6. </p>

<p>Electrons pass through the layers of the semiconductor material of LED and are absorbed in the depletion region (light-emitting region) and this is happening when electrical current flows through an LED. When an atom in the depletion zone absorbs an electron, one of its already orbiting electrons in lower states moves to a higher state. In this higher state, the atom and orbiting electron are unstable and will ultimately want to resume their normal or lower state. To get back the electron from higher state to lower state the absorbed energy must be removed or emitted by the atom. This emitted energy is in the form of a massless particle called a photon. See the light section to know more</p>
<h5>Laser Diodes</h5>
<p>Some advantages of using laser diodes are below: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Higher efficiency of electrical-to-optical conversion </li>
    <li>Higher speed then the LED diodes</li>
    <li>Narrower optical bandwidth,</li>
    <li>Better optical output power than the LED </li>
</ul>
<p>All laser diodes also emit light randomly in all directions like as LED. When current increases at a certain level in laser diode then output light is suddenly much higher, this fact is called “lasing” in Figure 7.</p>

</figure>
<p>To do “lasing” two special conditions should be met. First, semiconductor material atoms must have more electrons in the higher energy state than in the lower energy state. The second condition is after the emission of photons they are must be channeled, so they can stimulate other atoms to produce other photons. This optical channel is called Fabry-Perot cavity, Fabry and Perot are the last names of two founding scientists. Inside the semiconductor material, there are two highly reflective mirrors at both ends of a channel which is called Fabry-Perot cavity in Figure 8.</p>
