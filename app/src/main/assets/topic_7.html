<h3>Optical Interconnection and Tools </h3>
<p>Normally electrical cables are connected with a connector, in the optical fiber system we also need a connector for connect but there as some different parts and techniques. There are two methods used to connect optical fiber:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Connectors</li>
    <li>Splices</li>
</ul>
<p>This table shows a comparison between connector and splices.</p>

<h4>Connectors</h4>
<p>By using a connecter, we can save the time and labor costs because it’s very fast to install. There are several types of connector type has different characteristic with advantages describing follow.</p>
<p> <em>SMA:</em> This connector has a stainless-steel structure and mainly use in high-power laser beams into large-core multimode fibers. Typical applications include laser beam delivery systems in medical, bio-medical, and industrial applications. The typical insertion loss of an SMA connector is greater than 1 dB.</p>
<p> <em>ST:</em> It has high-precision and ceramic ferrule which allows both multimode and single-mode fibers. The coupling mechanism in this connector prevents over tightening and damaging of the fiber end. The insertion loss of the ST connector is less than 0.5 dB.</p>
<p><em>FC:</em> This connector mainly used in single-mode fibers like in fiber-optic instruments, SM fiber optic components, and high-speed fiber-optic communication links. Multimode versions of this connector are also available. The typical insertion loss of the FC connector is around 0.3 dB.</p>
<p><em>SC:</em> The SC connector is becoming increasingly popular in single-mode fiber optic telecom and analog CATV, field deployed links. Multimode versions of this connector are also available. The typical insertion loss of the SC connector is around 0.3 dB.</p>
<br>
<h4>Splices</h4>
<p>Fiber optic splicing methods are very important to any fiber optic or telecommunication company because their loss is very low than the connector.</p>
<p>There are two methods of fiber optic splicing, fusion splicing & mechanical splicing.</p>
<h5>Mechanical Splicing </h5>
<p>A mechanical splice is only an alignment device, it designed to hold the two fiber ends in a precisely aligned position thus enabling light to pass from one fiber into the other (Typical loss: 0.3 dB) shown in Figure 16.</p>

<h5>Fusion Splicing</h5>
<p>In fusion splicing (Figure 17) a machine is used to weld together the two fiber ends after alignment. This produces a continuous connection between the fibers enabling very low loss light transmission (Typical loss: 0.1 dB).</p>

<h4>Which method is better? </h4>
<p>The reason for choosing the method is economic. In mechanical splicing initial investment is low (€800 to €1,600) but per splicing, the cost is higher (€10 to €30). On the other hand, in fusion splicing, the initial investment is much higher (€12,000 to €40,000) but per splicing, the cost is much lower (€0.40 to €1.20). </p>
<p>Fusion splicing only works in single mode fiber and mechanical splice can run both single and multimode networks.  </p>
<p>Telecommunication and CATV companies are mainly to invest in fusion splicing for their single-mode networks, but they also use mechanical splicing for the shorter and local cable network.</p>

<h4>Mechanical Splicing Method </h4>
<p>Mechanical splicing is not a permanent bond. Two fiber ends are aligning to a common centerline, so the light can pass from one fiber to another.</p>
<h5>There are four steps to performing a mechanical splice: </h5>
<p><b>Step 1:</b> Preparation of fiber – First step is cleaning the cable. We have to strip the protective coatings, jackets, tubes, strength members, etc. We need only the bare fiber.</p>
<p><b>Step 2:</b> Cleaving the fiber - We have to cleave the fiber for splicing. </p>
<p><b>Step 3:</b> Mechanically join the fibers – First position the fiber ends together inside the mechanical unit. Secondly, we have to use index matching gel inside the mechanical splice apparatus, it will help couple the light from one fiber end to the other.   There is no heat used in this method.  </p>
<p><b>Step 4:</b> Protect the fiber - the completed mechanical splice equips its own protection for the splice. </p>

<h4>Fusion Splicing Method</h4>
<p>As we said earlier, fusion splicing is a junction of two or more optical fibers that have been permanently fixed by welding them together using an electronic arc.</p>
<h5>There are four basic steps to completing a proper fusion splice: </h5>
<p><b>Step 1:</b> Preparation of fiber – First step is cleaning the cable. We have to strip the protective coatings, jackets, tubes, strength members, etc. We need only the bare fiber.</p>
<p><b>Step 2:</b> Cleaving the fiber – We need a good fiber cleaver for a successful fusion splice. To make a proper splice the cleaved end should be mirror-smooth and perpendicular to the fiber axis. Note: The cleaver does not cut the fiber! It just holds the fiber and then pulls or flexes it to make a clean break. By using a good cleaver, we can produce a cleave angle of 0.5 degrees or less. </p>
<p><b>Step 3:</b> Fuse the fiber - There are two steps in this step, alignment, and heating. Alignment can be manual or automatic depending on what equipment use using. The higher-priced equipment gives accurate alignment. After properly alignment then we have to an electrical arc to melt the fibers, by this we can permanently weld the two fiber ends together. </p>
<p><b>Step 4:</b> Protect the fiber – We have to protect the fiber from bending and tensile forces. We have to ensure that the splice doesn't break during normal handling. A typical fusion splice will not break during normal handling, but it still requires protection from excessive bending and pulling forces. A fusion has a tensile strength between 0.5 and 1.5 lbs. By using silicone gel, heat shrink tubing, and/or mechanical crimp protectors will keep the splice protected from outside elements and breakage. </p>
<br>
<h4>Rules for Better Splices: </h4>
<p>1.  We need to clean the splicing tool frequently. All particle is not visible to the open eyes that’s why we have to clean splicing tool carefully otherwise it causes a serious problem when working with fiber optic.</p>
<p>2. The cleaver is the most valuable tool in fiber splicing because in mechanical splicing we need the proper angel in the end face otherwise too much light will escape in the air gap of two fibers. The index matching gel will eliminate most of the light escape but can’t function with a low-quality cleave. A good quality cleaver cost about €80 to €800 for use for mechanical splicing.</p>
<p>For Fusion splicing, we need an even more precise cleaver (€800 to €3000) for low loss (0.05 dB and less). By using a poor clever fiber ends might not melt together and its cause light loss and high reflection problem.  </p>
<p>3.  In fusion splicing fusion parameters must be adjusted minimally and methodically. We have to check about the cleanness of the equipment and then continue with the parameters. The two key factors for splicing are fusion time and fusion current. Different variables of these two factors can produce the same splice results.  High current and low time result in the same outcome as high time and low current. If we change one variable at a time we have to keep checking until you have found the right fusion parameters for fiber type [3]. </p>

<h4>OTDR - Optical Time Domain Reflectometer </h4>
<p>To certify the performance of new fiber optics links and detect problems with existing fiber links we use an Optical Time Domain Reflectometer (OTDR).</p>
<p>For testing fiber-optic links (e.g., in cable TV, LAN, metropolitan networks, or long-distance Internet backbones) this is mostly used in the technology of optical fiber communications in terms of distributed propagation losses, localized losses e.g., due to optical components or poor fiber splices. We will explain the measurement method in the following section, which is called optical time-domain reflectometry.</p>
<p>A network operation can also be tested at a higher level with a bit error rate tester (BERT), but problems found on that level are not easy to track down. We use OTDR to analyze networks on a basic physical level, and they also often greatly help in localizing problems.</p>
<br>
<h4>OTDR TRACE</h4>
<p>In an OTDR a reflectometer sends a short pulse of light to the line and then records to what is reflected back. The optical fiber reflects back a little and analyzing the power of the reverse reflection and the time due to Rayleigh scattering. When this instantaneous power came, the OTDR puts dots on the axial plane, connecting them into a graph. </p>
<p>When there is a non-reflective fault (splice, kink), then the reflectometer level of the reflected signal before the fault will be higher than after it and is shows a step on the graph.</p>
<p>Sometimes there is a reflective fault like mechanical connection, break, or fiber end then the OTDR trace indicates in this place a powerful reflection. This is much higher than the light coming from Rayleigh scattering, and for this reason, we see a peak on the graph.</p>
<p>Since the first impulse is very rough and noisy, for a quality OTDR trace, a lot of impulses (thousands and tens of thousands) are sent to the line repeatedly, and the resulting OTDR trace is their average. The more impulses, the more accurate and smooth the OTDR trace, but we need to wait longer for the end of the measurement. The OTDR traces a noise area at the end of the fiber as a dead zone at the beginning. In Figure 18 a most typical OTDR trace is shown  below:</p>
