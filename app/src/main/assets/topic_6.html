    <h3>Optical Fiber Networks</h3>
    <p>Our information world becomes progressively complex and looking for ways to interconnect with others and to make the data itself more available to us. That's where the concept of networks comes in. </p>
    <p><em>Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI)</em>  is a modern system that was designed for fiber optics from the start. The information passes through this system in both directions as it has a dual fiber system as shown in Figure 15. One ring carries the information normally while the other is kept in reserve in case of a component or cable failure. In each direction, the data transmission rate is 100 Megabit/second. A concentrator type of nodes such as Ethernet or Token-Ring can be connected in the FDDI system [3].</p>
