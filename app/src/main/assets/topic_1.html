<h3>Basics of Light</h3>
<br>
<p>
  According to the modern theory concerning atoms, electrons move in orbits around the nucleus. If an electron absorbs energy it is promoted to a higher energy orbit. This situation is so unstable that after a very small period of time (much less than a second) and then it falls back to its previous orbit. During the fall it emits a photon.

<p>Einstein called these photons of energy packets, and these are now recognized as a fundamental particle. Visible light is carried by photons, and so are all the other kinds of electromagnetic radiation like X-rays, microwaves and radio waves. In other words, light is a particle. </p>
<p>All photons travel at the speed of light. Photons do not have electric charge or rest mass and one unit of spin; they are field particles that are thought to be the carriers of the electromagnetic field.</p>
<p>But how photon get this electromagnetic field? They got it from electron. An electron have an electric field and from maxwell law changing electrical field generates a changing magnetic field.</p>
<p>The wavelength of light λ (in meters), is related to the frequency v (in HZ) and to the speed of light c, by the equation: </p>
<p>λ = c/v</p>
<p>where c is the speed of light with a constant value of 300 million meters per second, is the frequency of the light in hertz (Hz) or cycles per second, and is the wavelength of the light in meters. </p>
<p>The relationship between the energy of a photon and its frequency is dictated by another simple equation: </p>
<p>E = hv = hc/λ</p>
<p>where E is the energy in kiloJoules per mole, h is Planck's constant with a value of 6.626 x 10-34 Joule-seconds per particle, and the other variables were defined above. </p>
