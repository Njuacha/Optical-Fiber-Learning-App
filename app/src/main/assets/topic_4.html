<h3>Fiber optic Receiver</h3>
<p>The fiber optic receiver converts optical light (coded information) to voltage. It’s a decoder. The basic elements of all fiber optic receivers are shown in Figure 10. The most important element of a fiber optic receiver is a photodetector.</p>

<h4>Photodetector</h4>
<p>The photodetector converts optical energy to an electrical current which is reversed action of the light source in the transmitter.</p>
<p>The main four basic semiconductor photodetector types are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Photodiode</li>
    <li>Avalanche Photodiode</li>
    <li>Phototransistor</li>
    <li>Photodarlington</li>
</ul>
<p>Light rays (photons) that come from the transmitter via optical fiber are absorbed by the photodetector material and creates free electrons from the semiconductor atoms. When a voltage applied as shown in Figure 11 then these freed electrons produce current flow.</p>
<p>These four photodetector types have advantages and disadvantages. Some are with high speed, and some have high gain. </p>
<h5>Photodiode</h5>

<p>The most popular detector of fiber optics is photodiodes. </p>
<p>Some advantages of photodiodes are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Cheap</li>
    <li>Easy to compel any electronic circuits</li>
    <li>Can operate with low voltage</li>
    <li>High Reliability</li>
</ul>
<p>A cross-section diagram of a photodiode is shown in Figure 12. </p>

<h5>Avalanche Photodiode (APD)</h5>
<p>The second most commonly used detector in fiber optic telecommunications systems is the avalanche photodiode, which is a specially designed photodiode.</p>
<p>It has some similarities to the laser diode. In laser diodes, only a few photons can produce many emitted photons. In an avalanche photodiode, a few photons produce many electrons and holes.</p>
<p>Compare to the photodiode, when a light (photon) is absorbed in the intrinsic region of the avalanche photodetector creates an electron-hole pair. Then this electron and hole accelerate away from each other by the strong electrical field, they hit the other stationary atoms and create more sets of electrons and holes. By this process, the number of electrons and holes increases, and it’s call avalanche.</p>
<p>Avalanche photodiodes are most often used in long distance optical fiber system.[2]</p>
