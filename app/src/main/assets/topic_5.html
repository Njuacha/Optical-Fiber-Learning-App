    <h3>Long Distances Optical Fiber</h3>
    <p>All types of signals lose strength by greater distance whether it carried by copper or fiber. While optical fiber has much more advantage compared to copper cable but after a distance, the optical signal also can’t be detected. To solve the problem of signal attenuation (strength loss) we use a repeater for amplifying the signal (in Figure 13).</p>

    <p>By using optical fiber it’s a great performance than the copper cable, in optical networks repeaters may be needed only every 50 kilometers where in copper cable networks like copper cable TV networks required repeaters in every kilometer. Fewer repeaters mean less expense to install and maintains. We have undersea cable, and it’s not possible all-time to go under a thousand feet below water to install or repaid repeater rapidly.</p>
    <h4>Repeaters</h4>
    <p>There are two types of repeater based on technologies: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Electronic</li>
        <li>Optical</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The most popular repeater is an electronic type. They first convert the optical signal to an electrical signal then amplifying it and send it again like the optical signal after converting. This function is similar to the electronic repeaters used for the cable TV system.</p>
    <h5>Optical Repeater (Optical Amplifier) </h5>
    <p>An optical amplifier takes a weak input optical signal and amplifies it directly to generate a strong signal. It contains a few components that’s why it’s very cheap. It doesn’t convert the optical signals to electrical signals like electronic amplifiers.</p>
    <p>The optical amplifier is a very modern technology enhancement.  In 1995 the first major commercial use was in a 2.5 Gigabit-per-second 294 km fiber link between Denmark and Norway. The optical amplifier can amplify multiple data rates and wavelengths and this is flexible for use in any analog or digital format. At this moment optical amplifier is expensive than an electronic converter, but costs are dropping. When manufacturing costs go down, this type of repeater will dominant all types of networks especially in long-distance communications worldwide.</p>
    <p>The working principle of the optical repeater is very simple as shown in Figure 14. Light makes only a single pass through the amplifier. In an optical amplifier, energy is input and stored by atoms like an upper “charged” state. When a photon comes from an optical fiber and strikes the atom, the photon stimulates the atom and the charged electron falls again in a normal state by emitting a photon. This second photon is an exact clone of the first photon in wavelength, polarization, and direction of travel. This process is repeated until the end of the amplifier. By this process, the signal is amplified [2].</p>
