<h3>Basics of Light</h3>
<p>
    Electrons move in orbits around the nucleus, we know this by the modern theory concerning atoms.  When an electron absorbs energy, it is promoted to a higher energy
    orbit but it lasts there a very short time (much less than a single second) and then it falls back to its previous orbit. At the time of the fall, it emits a photon as shown in Figure 1.

<p>Einstein called these photons of energy packets, and these are now identified as a fundamental particle.  We can say light is a particle. Visible light is carried by photons, and other kinds of electromagnetic radiation like X-rays, <em>microwaves</em>, and <em>radio waves</em>. </p>
<p>All photons travel at the speed of light. Photons do not have the electric charge or rest mass and one unit of spin; they are field particles that are thought to be the carriers of the electromagnetic field.</p>
<p>But how photon get this electromagnetic field? They got it from the electron. An electron has an electric field and from Maxwell’s law changing electrical field generates a changing magnetic field as shown in Figure 2. </p>

<p>The wavelength of light λ (in meters), is associate with the frequency v (in HZ) and to the speed of light c, so the equation: </p>
<p>λ = c/v</p>
<p>Here c is the speed of light with a constant value of 300 million meters per second, is the frequency of the light in hertz (Hz) or cycles per second, and is the wavelength of the light in meters. </p>
<p>In another simple equation we can easily express the interrelation of the energy of a photon and its frequency: </p>
<p>E = hv = hc/λ</p>
<p>Here E is the energy in kilojoules per mole, h is Planck's constant with a value of 6.626 x 10-34 Joule-seconds per particle, and the other variables we discussed earlier[1].</p>
